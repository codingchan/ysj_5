1,1,"COVID-19 Surges Among Unvaccinated in Florida, Contrary to Baseless Claims","Florida health officials have reported a 60% rise in COVID-19 cases, and hospitals are reporting that 95% of COVID-19 patients are not fully vaccinated. But a Facebook post makes the baseless claims that Florida’s numbers are not going up, and that all COVID-19 patients recently admitted to a Palm Beach County hospital had been vaccinated.","In recent weeks, Florida has seen a surge in new COVID-19 cases, and it has one of the highest rates of new infections in the U.S. 
The Florida Department of Health reported 73,199 new COVID-19 cases throughout the state between July 16 and July 22. That was an increase of more than 60% from the 45,584 cases reported the previous week, and a 210% increase from the 23,554 cases reported the week before that one. 
On July 17, more than 5,300 Floridians were in the hospital with COVID-19, the Florida Hospital Association reported, a 65% jump since July 16. The FHA’s July 28 COVID-19 report showed 8,816 hospitalizations.
Yet a popular Facebook post falsely claims that reports about Florida’s spike in cases are not accurate. “Don’t believe the hype that Florida numbers are up. It’s a blatant lie,” reads the July 25 post from Facebook user Erin Marie, whose full name is Erin Marie Olszewski. She claims to have gotten confirmation from “many of my other nursing colleagues here in Florida.”
But the data says otherwise.
In addition to the numbers we noted above from the Florida Department of Health and the Florida Hospital Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that as of July 28, Florida had 94,520 COVID-19 cases in the last seven days — the highest total in the nation. Florida’s seven-day case rate of 440.1 cases per 100,000 people was second only to Louisiana’s 554.1 cases per 100,000.
In that same seven-day time period, Florida also led the nation in total deaths from COVID-19, with 404, according to the CDC. Florida’s seven-day rate of 1.9 deaths per 100,000 people was third among all states, behind Nevada (3 per 100,000) and Arkansas (2.7 per 100,000).
As of July 28, the CDC said new admissions of Florida patients with confirmed COVID-19 averaged 1,206 over the seven days between July 20 and 26. That was a more than 60% increase from the seven-day average of 751 admissions the previous week.",COVID-19 Surges Among Unvaccinated in Florida.jpg
2,2,"Vaccines Remain Largely Effective Against Delta Variant, Counter to Claims From Fox News Guest","Multiple studies show the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines continue to be effective against the delta variant of the coronavirus, even if the potency of the vaccines is somewhat reduced. But a guest on Fox News falsely claimed the delta variant “really is not responsive at all, or protected at all by the vaccines” and there is “no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.”","The highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus now accounts for 82% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is partly responsible for the rising number of infections across the vast majority of the country.
Data show that while the authorized COVID-19 vaccines may be less protective against delta in preventing infections and symptomatic illness compared with earlier versions of SARS-CoV-2, they still largely remain effective — and are very good at preventing serious disease and death.
As CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a July 16 press briefing, “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” as outbreaks continue in places with low vaccination rates.
But that’s not the message Fox News guest Dr. Peter McCullough has been spreading. In a July 13 interview on “The Ingraham Angle,” the private practice internist played down the risks of the delta variant and falsely said there was “no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.”
“We are at a very low baseline now,” he said in reply to host Laura Ingraham, who asked him what to expect next from the pandemic. “We are going to have a slight rise with the delta variant, but the delta variant really is not responsive at all, or protected at all by the vaccines. So 42% of 90,000 proven delta cases in the U.K. have been vaccinated. In Israel, the estimate right now from the Israel health authorities that the vaccine efficacy rate is only about 60 to 70%. So we expect delta cases and in fully vaccinated individuals. It will be a mild rise. It’s easily treatable in high-risk patients. There is no reason right now, no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.”
As we’ll explain, McCullough, who has previously been a source of COVID-19 misinformation, including about vaccines, is correct about the Israeli percentage, but wrong about the U.K. one — and there is an abundance of data contradicting his claim that the vaccines do nothing against the delta variant.
As for the idea that COVID-19 is “easily treatable,” there is little to support that notion as well, especially with hundreds of Americans still dying every day from the disease.
“You’re much, much better off being vaccinated than not,” Frederic Bushman, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens, told us. “The delta variant may reduce the effectiveness [of the vaccines] a little, but still they’re so effective that you get a lot of benefit.”",Vaccines Remain Largely Effective Against Delta Variant.jpg
3,3,Viral Claim Gets Biden’s COVID-19 Travel and Immigration Policies Wrong,"The Biden administration hasn’t introduced COVID-19 travel restrictions on Americans going to Mexico since the delta variant became dominant in the U.S., and it is enforcing immigration laws at the border. But a meme falsely claiming the opposite is circulating online.","Two topics that routinely draw false claims on social media are COVID-19 and immigration at the U.S. border with Mexico.
A claim currently circulating online misrepresents the Biden administration’s actions on both issues.
A Twitter account with “trump won” in its bio posted this false claim, which has been retweeted more than 2,700 times and shared on Facebook: “The COVID delta variant is so deadly Biden is restricting travel for Americans into Mexico but is keeping the border wide open for illegal aliens to walk right into our country.”
Neither of its major points is correct. Biden hasn’t initiated any travel restrictions for Americans going to Mexico since the delta variant became dominant in the U.S. in July, and his administration is enforcing existing immigration laws.
As for the travel portion of the claim, the administration has recently extended restrictions on non-essential travel from Mexico into the United States at land ports of entry due to COVID-19 through Aug. 21. But the travel limits have been in effect since March 21, 2020, and they do not prevent U.S. citizens and permanent lawful residents from traveling to Mexico or returning to the United States. Also, the restrictions apply only to land and ferry border crossing, not air travel.
Although there is no restriction on Americans flying to Mexico, those who do fly there will have to provide negative COVID-19 test results before their return flight. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that pandemic-related order on Jan. 12 under the previous administration, and it went into effect on Jan. 26 under Biden — so it’s not new, either.
The State Department also urges travelers to reconsider going to Mexico since the CDC has listed the country’s COVID-19 risk level as “high.” That’s the third level in the CDC’s four-tiered system.
The part of the claim asserting that the border is “wide open for illegal aliens” is also wrong. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has made hundreds of thousands of apprehensions and expulsions at the southwest border since Biden took office.
More than 500,000 expulsions were made from February to June under Title 42, a public health law the Trump administration began using in March 2020 to expel people at the border in the name of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
During the Trump administration, from March 2020 to January 2021 there were more than 459,000 expulsions.
Many Democrats and immigrant advocates have urged Biden to rescind the policy, but it remains in effect.
So, the claim is wrong about both travel restrictions and border policy.",Viral Claim Gets Biden’s COVID-19 Travel and Immigration Policies Wrong.jpg
4,4,Flawed Variant Information Fuels Baseless COVID-19 Theory,"A conspiracy theory online baselessly suggests that the World Health Organization and other groups preplanned the variants of the novel coronavirus — citing a dubious timeline. But the timeline doesn’t square with the reality of when variants have been identified and designated thus far.


","The World Health Organization in late May moved to a new system for naming certain variants of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Specifically, the WHO said it would use letters of the Greek alphabet for labeling variants of interest and variants of concern. As we’ve explained, viruses mutate as they replicate. A mutation is one change to the genetic sequence of a virus, and a variant is a distinct virus, typically with several mutations.
A conspiracy theory shared on social media, however, is baselessly suggesting that public health officials and others somehow preplanned the variants. But the posts spreading the theory ignore the facts of how — and, more importantly, when — SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified to date.
“These are the PLANNED COVID-19 VARIANTS – just look at the dates when they will be ‘released’ to the media,” reads one image shared in a July 26 Instagram post, which was liked more than 1,000 times. “DON’T BE STUPID, YOU ARE BEING PLAYED AND MANIPULATED.”
The image includes a table with a list of the letters of the Greek alphabet (though the table begins with delta) under the Spanish label “Cepa/variante,” meaning “strain/variant.” Next to each letter is a month and year for “Lanzamiento,” Spanish for “launch,” through February 2023.
Beside the table are the logos of various groups — including the World Health Organization, World Economic Forum, Johns Hopkins University and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — seeming to suggest the groups are behind the purported plan to announce a new variant every month.
It’s unclear where the table actually originated though, and there’s no proof it came from the entities cited. Representatives for the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation all told us the table did not come from their organizations.
What we do know is that the dubious timeline has been circulating on social media since at least early July, and has been spread with posts in various languages — such as English, Spanish and Italian.
But the table doesn’t square with the actual timing of when SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified and labeled to date.
For example, the table indicates that the delta variant will be launched in June 2021. But that variant was first documented in India in October 2020, according to the WHO, and was deemed a variant of interest in April 2021. It became a variant of concern in May and has now become the dominant variant in the U.S.
A number of other variants also have been identified months ahead of what the timeline purports will happen.
The eta, iota, kappa and lambda variants were all first documented in late 2020, and were deemed variants of interest between March and June 2021. But the social media table suggests those variants wouldn’t be announced until later this year or early 2022.
Baseless claims that the pandemic was somehow preplanned have been circulating since the very start of the spread of the novel coronavirus. The social media posts now citing a purported variant timeline don’t make that theory any more credible.",Flawed Variant Information Fuels Baseless COVID-19 Theory.jpg
5,5,Viral Posts Misrepresent CDC Announcement on COVID-19 PCR Test,"Scientists consider polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests a highly reliable tool for diagnosing COVID-19. But social media posts are misrepresenting a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement regarding the eventual discontinuation of its own test, falsely claiming the government has conceded that PCR tests aren’t reliable.","In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed and deployed its own polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test to identify infections with the novel coronavirus (although its initial rollout was beset with some issues).
A year and a half later, the federal agency has notified labs that it will — at the end of 2021 — withdraw its emergency use authorization request for the test to the Food and Drug Administration, thereby discontinuing its use.
The agency in a July 21 notice recommended that labs use “one of the many FDA-authorized alternatives” and said it “encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.” Such multiplex tests, including one from the CDC, can look for both the novel coronavirus and multiple types of influenza at the same time — which conserves testing materials and allows public health labs to do influenza surveillance while testing for SARS-CoV-2, or the virus that causes COVID-19.
But the CDC did not say it was no longer supporting the use of PCR tests in general, many of which have been authorized by the FDA — or that its original PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 can’t tell the difference between coronavirus and influenza — as viral posts spreading online falsely claim.
“After 180 million positive cases, the CDC have announced their withdrawal statement from using the PCR test to detect Covid, due to its lack of detection to differentiate between Covid and Influenza,” read a July 25 tweet screenshot posted to Instagram. The post received more than 4,000 likes.
A July 26 Facebook post similarly claimed: “Big News-CDC withdraws PCR test from FDA EUA. It’s inability to differentiate Covid from Influenza was #1 reason.”
The CDC’s PCR test in question looks only for SARS-CoV-2, not influenza — which is quite different from a test that mistakenly diagnoses influenza cases as COVID-19, as the posts erroneously suggest.
Other posts have falsely claimed it was the FDA that made the purported revelation about the CDC’s PCR test, or PCR tests in general.
A since-deleted July 23 tweet from “UK Medical Freedom” falsely claimed that the “FDA announced today that the CDC PCR test for COVID-19 has failed its full review. Emergency Use Authorization has been REVOKED.”
Two days later, on July 25, a controversial gym owner in New Jersey, Ian Smith, falsely claimed in a viral tweet that the “FDA confirms PCR tests not accurate for testing COVID.” He referred to COVID-19 as a “Manufactured crisis.”
As we said, the announcement in question came from the CDC and was about plans for the eventual discontinuation of its own test. It is still in use currently. The FDA did not revoke the CDC test’s emergency use authorization or question the reliability of PCR tests, an FDA spokesman confirmed to us.
Scientists consider PCR tests a reliable and highly specific diagnostic tool, as we’ve explained before, but distortions about them have persisted amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
In explaining the CDC’s decision to end the use of its own PCR test at the end of 2021, Kristen Nordlund, an agency spokeswoman, in an email to us cited “the availability of commercial options for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including multiplexed (discussed here) and high-throughput options” — referring to technologies that use an automated process to administer hundreds of tests per day.
“Although the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel met an important unmet need when it was developed and deployed and has not demonstrated any performance issues, the demand for this test has declined with the emergence of other higher-throughput and multiplexed assays,” Nordlund said.
She continued: “CDC is encouraging public health laboratories (PHL) to adopt the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay to enable continued surveillance for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which will save both time and resources for PHL.”
The FDA’s website lists a multitude of PCR tests for COVID-19 that have been issued emergency use authorizations.
Jim McKinney, an FDA spokesman, told us in an email that to date, “the FDA has authorized more than 380 tests and sample collection kits to diagnose COVID-19, many of which are PCR tests. PCR tests are generally considered to be the ‘gold standard’ for COVID-19 diagnosis.”
“The FDA has not issued any statement questioning the reliability of PCR test results in general and will continue to consider authorization for validated PCR tests,” he added.
Dr. Michael Mina, a Harvard University assistant professor of epidemiology, told us that the CDC’s decision regarding its test made sense, given how the landscape has changed.
“CDC is likely going to pull its own EUA for its test because hundreds of other labs now have their own EUAs and CDC no longer even needs to use its own test since many companies now have EUAs for manufactured tests,” he said in an email. “The major Companies like Roche, Hologic, Abbott all have their own test kits and instruments. Then the ThermoFishers of the world have EUAs for their PCR kits that can be run in the exact same way as the CDC assay. So there really is no reason for CDC to retain their EUA.”
Mina said the move had to be done carefully, since some public health labs may currently be relying on the CDC’s test.
“At the end of the day, the CDC EUA was more or less a recipe for how to test for CoVID, and a couple ingredients,” Mina said. “Now we have all these kits and fully automated processes so it’s no longer needed.”",Viral Posts Misrepresent CDC Announcement on COVID-19 PCR Test.jpg
6,6,Viral Posts Misuse VAERS Data to Make False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccines,"Social media posts repeatedly misuse unverified data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System to falsely claim that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous, and even lethal. But the government database is not designed to determine if vaccines cause health problems.","Millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. 
Over 145 million doses had been administered as of March 30, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and over 95 million people had received at least one dose of the vaccine. 
Most of those who have reported side effects have said they were minor, such as pain or swelling at the injection site, headaches, chills or fever — which are all consistent with the results of clinical trials. Some people have no side effects at all. And a small number of people (2 to 5 people per million vaccinated) have reported a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which “almost always” happens within a half an hour of being vaccinated, the CDC says. 
Yet over and over websites and social media posts improperly cite unverified raw data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an alert system managed by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to detect possible safety issues in vaccines, as evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths and serious events. 
Take this Instagram video, seen by over 36,000 users. In the video, a female narrator walks viewers through the VAERS website and shows them how to find adverse reactions reported to the database after people received the COVID-19 vaccines. 
“Acute myocardial infarction. That is a stroke, if you guys aren’t aware of what that means,” she says incorrectly at the 2:30 mark, as she scrolls down through the results. A myocardial infarction is a heart attack. 
And a couple of minutes later: “Death. And here we are y’all —  this is exactly what you guys wanted to see. Death. Patient passed away in her sleep. Look at all these deaths you guys,” the narrator says scrolling down through dozens of death reports. 
“Do your own research,” writes the account owner on the post, a man under the name “Truth Bombs,” who in a second similar post says he’s not a scientist or a doctor but a concerned father, patriot and digital soldier. “There are very serious side effect from getting the vaccines. Here’s your PROOF.”
Except, as the VAERS website warns, any report submitted to the database “is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.” 
As we’ve explained before, anyone can submit a report of an event to VAERS, even if it’s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem. All reports are accepted into the database without determining whether the event was caused by a particular vaccine, and therefore, as a disclaimer warns, submissions “may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.” 
“One of the main limitations of VAERS data is that it cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event,” reads its website. “This limitation has caused confusion in the publicly available data from VAERS WONDER, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. There have been instances where people have misinterpreted reports of deaths following vaccination as deaths caused by the vaccines; that is not accurate.”
So when VAERS says it has received 2,509 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine as of March 29, that does not mean that those deaths were caused by the vaccine. 
In fact, after reviewing medical records, autopsies and death certificates for all of those cases, physicians from both the CDC and the FDA determined that there was “no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.”",Viral Posts Misuse VAERS Data to Make False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccines.jpg
7,7,Research Rebuts Claims Linking COVID-19 Vaccines to Male Infertility,"A new study found there was no negative effect on sperm levels in men after receiving the COVID-19 vaccines, undercutting suggestions that the shots affect male fertility. But social media posts have made the baseless claim that vaccinated men “are effectively sterile.”","Early in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., we addressed questions and claims about the impact of vaccination on fertility. Some claims used a bogus argument to conclude that the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — would cause “female sterilization.” In reality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that there is no evidence any vaccine, including those for COVID-19, cause fertility problems.
More recently, some posts swirling on social media have spread an unfounded narrative that the vaccines will create widespread infertility problems for men.
A May 23 story published on a website called the Daily Expose, based in the U.K., and shared on Facebook more than 1,100 times, claims that the “VACCINES could cause ‘mass male infertility.'”
The story cites an interview with Roger Hodkinson — a Canadian pathologist who in 2020 reportedly called COVID-19 “the biggest hoax,” erroneously likening the disease to the flu. It claims that “the spike protein expresses in the placenta and the testes,” which “could kill unborn babies in current pregnancies and permanently stop men having children.” The Daily Expose story also takes aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggesting the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a “dead man walking.”
The claims have been republished on other websites and spread elsewhere, including on Twitter and Instagram — where one popular post declared that “all males who have been vaccinated are effectively sterile.”
But experts say there is no evidence that the vaccines cause infertility in men. And there are new data that further undercut the online claims.

8,8,Biden Adviser Didn’t Propose Requiring COVID-19 Vaccine for Food Stamps,"A report from two dozen experts — including a doctor named to President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board — recommended using existing social service programs to connect people with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The report did not advise requiring vaccination in order to receive such services, as social media posts falsely claim.","When a COVID-19 vaccine is approved and ready, health officials will need to coordinate its distribution to hundreds of millions of people and help the public overcome misperceptions.
Dubious websites and social media posts, however, are spreading a falsehood about a report outlining distribution strategies, wrongly accusing a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory team of wanting to mandate vaccination by tying it to food assistance.
On Instagram, users shared screenshots of a Nov. 12 headline from the website Natural News, falsely claiming, “VAX THE BLACKS: Joe Biden’s Covid-19 taskforce member recommends withholding food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.”
Natural News was banned by Facebook earlier this year for using foreign trolls to spread its unreliable content.
The vaccine story, which also appeared on an affiliated website called Distributed News, specifically says that Dr. Luciana Borio, recently named a member of Biden’s Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board, “says that people who refuse to be vaccinated should be deprived of food stamps and rent assistance.”
That is false.
The story offers a distorted take on one part of a July report published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — “The Public’s Role in COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social, Behavioral, and Communication Sciences.” The report was the result of a working group of about two dozen experts, including Borio.
The report did not recommend that vaccine “mandates” be tied to social service programs, such as food stamps and rent assistance, as the Natural News story claims.
Instead, one of the report’s recommendations is to “Make Vaccination Available in Safe, Familiar, and Convenient Places.” The report explains that making vaccines widely available will “entail local and state health departments’ developing vaccination capacity, creating local adaptations to meet communities — and, particularly, vulnerable populations — where they are, and communicating timely information in clear and accessible ways.”
In a statement provided to us in response to the viral story, Dr. Monica Schoch-Spana and Emily K. Brunson, the lead authors of the Johns Hopkins report, said that they “do NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual’s vaccination status.”
The statement said the viral story contained “factual inaccuracies and misleading statements” about the report’s recommendations, and that the authors “take exception to the singling out and professional misrepresentation” of Borio.
“We support voluntary vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should NOT be mandated,” the statement added. “We do advocate the provision of timely, accurate, and meaningful information so that individuals can make well-informed decisions about whether or not to accept vaccination for themselves or dependents in their care.”
Schoch-Spana and Brunson further said they “support efforts to make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines readily available to everyone who wants one, including individuals with limited means.” One way to do that is to provide the vaccines “at places where these individuals already go such as WIC clinics and food banks,” they said.",Biden Adviser Didn’t Propose Requiring COVID-19 Vaccine for Food Stamps.jpg
9,9,Story Twists Facts on Diagnosing Breakthrough COVID-19 Cases,A viral headline shared on social media falsely asserts that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed testing thresholds to “virtually eliminate” COVID-19 cases among vaccinated individuals. That’s wrong. The threshold in question simply applies to whether or not there is enough virus present in a sample for further analysis.,"As part of its efforts to track breakthrough COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently offered public health departments and labs guidance for when to send the federal agency samples from such cases.
The agency defines breakthrough infections as those that occur when someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at least two weeks after they receive their final dose of a vaccine. Specimens from some of those cases are collected so that scientists can sequence the sample, which can identify specific variants of the virus.
A false claim spreading on social media distorts the facts on this issue, wrongly asserting that the CDC has changed COVID-19 testing procedures to no longer count cases among vaccinated people.
The website Zero Hedge — known for spreading misinformation — ran a May 23 story headlined, “Caught Red-Handed: CDC Changes Test Thresholds To Virtually Eliminate New COVID Cases Among Vaxx’d.” It was shared on Facebook more than 13,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
The story was actually republished from a website called off-guardian.org, whose own post garnered more than 2,000 shares on Facebook.
But the claims made in the story rest on a misrepresentation of what the CDC said.
The piece begins by accusing the agency of “altering its practices of data logging and testing for ‘Covid19’ in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy ‘vaccines’ are effective at preventing the alleged disease.”
First of all, as we’ve explained, experts say the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are not gene therapy. While some have made that claim about the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — the vaccines do not modify a person’s genes. A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson also told us in a recent email that “none of these vaccines are defined as a gene therapy.”
And the vaccines have proven to be highly effective in clinical trials — and, so far, in real-world use. For more, see our SciCheck stories on the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines.
The viral story focuses on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests — which have been used to diagnose COVID-19 — and the issue of cycle threshold values. The piece dubiously purports that high cycle threshold values have been responsible for false-positive cases that have helped to cause “an entirely created pandemic narrative.”
As we’ve outlined before, a PCR test works by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. The test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load — meaning more virus is present in the sample — will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles.
There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — “although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint” of a PCR run — Ian Mackay, a virologist in Australia, previously told us.
The central debate among scientists in regards to COVID-19 cases detected at high cycle threshold values (meaning less virus is present) isn’t whether they are false positives, but how to interpret and act on those cases. For example, a sample detected at a cycle threshold of 45 could mean the person already had COVID-19 and is no longer contagious; though, alternatively, it could also mean someone only recently became infected.
The viral story claims that “NOW, and only for fully vaccinated people, the CDC will only accept samples achieved from 28 cycles or fewer. That can only be a deliberate decision in order to decrease the number of ‘breakthrough infections’ being officially recorded.”
That’s not what the CDC has said about a cycle threshold of 28.
Instead, the CDC said samples submitted for genetic sequencing would need to be at that threshold. Scientists use sequencing to decode the genes of the virus to better understand factors such as its spread and evolution.
On its informational page for public health departments and laboratories, the CDC provides instructions for submitting samples to the agency for breakthrough infection monitoring. There, the CDC says: “For cases with a known RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, submit only specimens with Ct value ≤28 to CDC for sequencing. (Sequencing is not feasible with higher Ct values.)”
The threshold doesn’t pertain to deciding whether the test is positive or not.
“The CDC is still counting positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular results with any cycle threshold value as it pertains to case counts,” Matthew Binnicker, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, told us in an email. “However, for sequencing studies, laboratories need a certain amount of the virus’ RNA in a sample for the sequencing to be successful. In other words, if there is a low amount of the viral RNA present, the sequencing will not produce results that can be interpreted.”
CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed told us the same.
Reed said in an email that the “Ct value ≤28 is not used to define whether a specimen is positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. The Ct value cutoff of 28 is only for submitting specimens that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 to CDC for sequencing.”
“Different labs will use different cutoffs for deciding when to perform sequencing. However, the Ct value needed to perform sequencing will not vary by vaccination status,” she added. “In general, CDC uses the same Ct value cutoff for submitting other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance specimens for sequencing. That cutoff is set because at Ct values >28 it becomes increasingly difficult to successfully sequence the specimen because the RNA levels in the specimens are generally too low.”

10,10,"Flawed Paper on COVID-19 Vaccines, Deaths Spreads Widely Before Retraction",The COVID-19 vaccines have been shown in trials and real-world application to be safe and effective. But a paper shared widely online claimed that vaccines cause two deaths for every three lives saved. Experts say the analysis misinterpreted data and was flawed — and it has now been retracted by the journal that published it.,"Unverified reports of adverse events that occur following receipt of a vaccine have been a key source of misinformation for months. As we’ve repeatedly documented, anyone can submit a report to the U.S. system and the reports alone are not proof of a link to a vaccine.
In the latest iteration of that type of data being misrepresented, a peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal used it to dubiously claim that the COVID-19 vaccines were causing deaths at such a scale that they nearly rival the number of lives saved through the vaccines.
“For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination,” the paper, published on June 24 in Vaccines, claimed.
Days after the analysis was published — amid backlash from scientists, some of whom resigned from editorial roles with the publication — the journal issued a June 28 statement noting that there were “significant concerns” with the paper and that its assertion that the deaths were linked to vaccination “is incorrect and distorted.”
“The data has been misused because it makes the (incorrect) assumption that all deaths occurring post vaccination are caused by vaccination,” Katie Ewer, an immunologist at the University of Oxford, told Science in an email. “[And] it is now being used by anti-vaxxers and COVID-19-deniers as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe. [This] is grossly irresponsible, particularly for a journal specialising in vaccines.”
Vaccines, based in Switzerland, formally retracted the paper on July 2.
But in the days between its publication and retraction, the paper and its claims found a significant audience on social media, where they were spread widely across platforms.
The link to the paper was shared nearly 9,000 times on Facebook as of early July 2, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. Metrics on the journal’s site indicate it was viewed more than 367,000 times.
Liz Wheeler, a conservative commentator, promoted the paper in a June 30 video on Facebook — viewed more than 250,000 times — titled, “The Vaccine Study You’re Not Allowed To See.”
“This is a peer-reviewed, scientific study,” Wheeler tells her viewers. “Essentially, this peer-reviewed scientific study shows that COVID-19 vaccine causes two deaths for every three lives it saves.” 
Behind her in parts of the video is a board repeating the study’s claim as a statement of fact: “COVID vax kills two people for every three saved.”
As we said, the journal had acknowledged two days earlier that the data about purported deaths from the vaccines had been “distorted.”
The paper said that the authors used “the data of the Dutch national register … to gauge the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations.”
But the Dutch reporting system — maintained by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, called Lareb — includes a prominent disclaimer explicitly stating that a reported side effect may not be from the vaccine, similar to the adverse event reporting system used in the U.S., which we’ve explained.
Dr. Eugène van Puijenbroek, head of science and research at Lareb, told us in an email that the data used in the analysis “were interpreted incorrectly and therefore led to erroneous conclusions.” He said he had requested that the journal “make either an appropriate correction” or retract the study.
The system is used to “highlight possible safety signals at an early stage,” he said. “A reported event that occurred after vaccination is therefore not necessarily being caused by the vaccination, although our data was presented as being causally related by the authors. It should be noted that also the database of the European Medicines Agency that is mentioned in this article contains the same type of reports.”
“As clearly stated on our website, but not taken [into] account in the method applied in this article, death after vaccination does not imply that the adverse event is indeed the actual cause of death,” he said. “Existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases. In a limited number of reports, adverse events following immunisation, known to be associated with the COVID vaccines (e.g. fever, nausea or malaise), may have contributed to the worsening of an already fragile health condition or an underlying medical condition. Suggesting all reports with a fatal outcome to be causally related is far from truth.”
Also, Van Puijenbroek said, the paper’s assertion that the reported deaths “were certified by medical specialists” is “simply incorrect.”
The lead author of the study, Harald Walach, is a psychologist and professor at Poznan University of the Medical Sciences in Poland. He and his co-authors penned a two-page letter defending their study, published by Retraction Watch, in which they admitted “that these data are far from perfect” but said they were justified in using the data for analysis because “they are the only ones that are available.”
They also claimed that “[c]urrently we only have association, we agree, and we never said anything else.”","Flawed Paper on COVID-19 Vaccines, Deaths Spreads Widely Before Retraction.jpg"
